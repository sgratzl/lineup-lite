LineUp-lite is an extension of the excellent [react-table](https://react-table.tanstack.com/) library for rendering beautiful interactive table visualizations based on the [LineUp](https://jku-vds-lab.at/tools/lineup/) ranking visualization technique.

## Background

LineUp-lite is the small, lite, but customizable nephew of [LineUp.js](https://lineup.js.org). LineUp.js is a comprehensive JavaScript library, providing numerous advanced ranking features and scalability. However, in most cases, only a fraction of the provided features are needed and used. In addition, new custom features are often required.

This is where LineUp-lite jumps in. LineUp-lite is a [React](https://reactjs.org) library written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) providing a range of React components ranging from `LineUpLite` - a ready to use ranking table visualization - down to individual components such as `Histogram` or `BoxPlot`.
