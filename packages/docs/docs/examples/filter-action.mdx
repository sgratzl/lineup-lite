LineUp-lite supports extending the column header with additional actions.
In the following example the filter action is customized with a custom filter dialog

LineUp-lite doesn't have an integrated filter action due to the different dialog designs
in different environments. Depending on ones needs, one want to show it as a modal dialog
or as an inline popover like in this example.
