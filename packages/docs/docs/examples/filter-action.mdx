title: Custom Column Action (Filter Dialog)
hide_table_of_contents: true
---

LineUp-lite supports extending the column header with additional actions.
In the following example a new action is registered to provide a filter icon and dialog.

LineUp-lite doesn't have an integrated filter action due to the different dialog designs
in different environments. Depending on ones needs, one want to show it as a modal dialog
or as an inline popover like in this example.
However, it provides the `LineUpLiteFilterAction` which simplifies the creation of such an action.
