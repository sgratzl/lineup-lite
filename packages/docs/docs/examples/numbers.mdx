LineUp-lite supports [number array column](/docs/components/numbers).
Each attribute is not only a single number but an array of them.
Rows are rendered using a 1D HeatMap where color encodes the value.
Group aggregates are rendered as a list of vertical boxplots indicating the distribution within the group for each cell.
