title: Customize Grouping Options
hide_table_of_contents: true

LineUp-lite supports extending the column header with additional actions.
In the following example the group by action is customized allowing to set column specific grouping options.

LineUp-lite doesn't have an integrated grouping options dialog due to the different dialog designs
in different environments. Depending on ones needs, one want to show it as a modal dialog
or as an inline popover like in this example.
